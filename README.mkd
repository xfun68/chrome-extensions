# My Chrome Extensions

  Some handy extensions to help me learning english, remind me to browse some pages cause I hadn't time when I first found them.

## myCollections

  This extension is used for collecting some useful words, sentences or paragraphs from web pages,
  so that you can pick them up again when you are free, other than forgetting them like never seen them.
